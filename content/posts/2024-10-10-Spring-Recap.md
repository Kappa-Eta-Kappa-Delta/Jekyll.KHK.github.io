### Welcome back to all the members for the Fall 2024 semester! 
As Spring 2024 president I just wanted to remind everyone of some of my favorite moments of the Spring semester, and inspire everyone to make the next one just as fun.

I was most excited about the success of the Engineering EXPO project. For the last few years, KHK did not participate in the EXPO, an event where Engineering Student Organizations present cool engineering projects to local middle and high school students. I wanted to make sure we participated last semester to improve our public image and give our members an opportunity to contribute to a group project for collaborative experience. We ended up coding a KHK-themed flappy bird game in Python from scratch, and we made it interactive by giving the kids the opportunity see how changes in code was reflected in the game. For example, they could change the size of the bird, the speed that it flies, the acceleration of gravity, and any aspect of the game. 

Our project was really engaging for the students, and it showed when we won an honorable mention and $125 award for one of the top booths. I am very proud of our membership for pulling this off and look forward to what we will have to offer at the EXPO this year!
