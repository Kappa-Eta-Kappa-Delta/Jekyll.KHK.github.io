### We are thrilled to announce that KHK has welcomed 10 outstanding new active members for the Spring 2024 semester! 

Under the exceptional guidance of our pledge trainers, Tanner, Brendan, and Ryan, these new members have demonstrated their dedication, resilience, and commitment to the values of our fraternity. Tanner led the team with incredible passion and purpose, while Brendan and Ryan provided invaluable support and mentorship throughout the pledging process.

Thanks to the efforts of our pledge trainers, our new actives have grown tremendously, forging strong bonds and creating memories that will last a lifetime. As these members transition into their new roles, we are excited to see the positive impact they will continue to have on KHK. Congratulations to our newest actives â€“ your journey is just beginning, and we are proud to have you as part of our fraternity's future!
