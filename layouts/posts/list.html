						Delta chapter of Kappa Eta Kappa (<strong>KHK</strong>) was founded at the University of
						Wisconsin as an electrical engineering fraternity on February 9th, 1924. Many years have gone by
						and the chapter is still going strong. Today many of our members also study computer
						engineering, computer science and other technical programs.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our location has changed a few times over the many years. Today we're located right on campus at
						<strong>114 N. Orchard St.</strong> in Madison Wisconsin. This house has been great for us. It's
						a block away from CS, two blocks from Engineering Dr. and a block away from Camp Randall.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our Members have a high reputation for starting successful careers right out of school. Many of
						them immediately start work in industry. Others go on to graduate programs at the UW and
						elsewhere. Some recent talent has gone off to big companies such as <i>Google</i>,
						<i>Qualcomm</i>, and <i>Northrop Grumman</i>. Some have been fortunate to stay local at places
						like <i>Epic</i>, <i>X-ES Engineering</i>, and <i>Hardin Design and Development</i>.
					</p>
					<p>
						Here at KHK, we build life-long relationships. Through tradition and legacy, we're close enough
						to call ourselves a family. We support each other academically and personally. As part of our
						mission, we know that social growth is just as important as professional growth. We are always
						engaging with the community. Our house has an open door for Badger gamedays and other socials.
