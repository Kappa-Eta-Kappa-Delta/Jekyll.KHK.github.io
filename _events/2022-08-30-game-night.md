Join us for our first Game Night of the semester! Starting at 6 and ending at 8, snacks and drinks will be available, as well as friendly competition with board and video games. It’s guaranteed to be a great time and a chance to meet the members. In case you miss this night or want to continue competing against us in Smash (our members are pretty good!!), there will be another Game Night on Wednesday, February 16th.
