We all know what its like at this point in the semester. Exams and essays are right around the corner, so KHK is hosting a study night for people to get prepared during this busy time! It's also always more fun to study with other people. You can meet a bunch of our actives in a relaxed and quiet environment, and are able to discuss and ask questions about concepts with our actives that might be in your classes (chances are, if you are a computer science major, the answer is yes!).
