Join us this long weekend for a Grill Out! We will be, as the title suggests, grilling and meeting outside. Socially distancing and masks are required if interested. Here, we provide an opportunity to get a feel for what KHK is like during weekends, as well as get familiar with some of our members!

Update for this semester:<br/>
Due to COVID19, KHK will be reevaluating our in-person events and look towards a way to create online events instead. Thank you for understanding,
and please contact our president (Sathwik Pattem) for more information about what we are working on.
