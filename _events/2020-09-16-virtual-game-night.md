Join us for our Game Night of the semester! While we usually host it in our fraternity house, we will be hosting our game night online. Here, you can meet and hang out with our members, and play some video games with us as well. The link to join this will be provided as we approach the 16th!

If you have any favorite games feel free to bring them with and introduce the house to a new game. If you canâ€™t make the event make sure to [visit us at one of our other events]({{site.baseurl}}/events). ;)
