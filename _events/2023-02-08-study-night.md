While nobody likes studying, studying is always better with other people there. KHK is hosting a study night at 1413 Engineering Hall (Cheney Room) from 4 PM to 6 PM! Swing by to crank out some homework and meet other members. Additionally, if you need some help, senior members will definitely be able to help you!
